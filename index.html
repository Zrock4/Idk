    <h1 class="myh1">About me!</h1>
    <h1 class="myh1">
      I'm someone whos genuinely passionate about learning new things in the
      world of technology, especially web development. I started by exploring
      the basics of HTML and CSS, and quickly realized how much I enjoy building
      simple pages and turning ideas into something real on the screen. I
      believe every small project is a chance to grow, improve, and get one step
      closer to mastering what I love. I'm always curious about how things work
      behind the scenes, and Im motivated to keep pushing myself forward.
      Outside of coding, I enjoy design, video games, and discovering tools that
      help me create better and more creative work. This website is my first
      step in building a digital identity, and Im excited to keep developing it
      as I continue learning and improving my skills as a developer and creative
      thinker.
